# Dynamic React Form Generator with Ant Design

This projectThe dynamic React form generator is a powerful tool that enables the rapid creation of complex and customizable forms within React applications. Leveraging the popular Ant Design component library and JSON configuration files, this code offers a streamlined approach to building intricate forms while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.

My objective with this is time-saving, once the form generator drastically cuts down development time by automating the creation of form elements and their corresponding logic. This is especially advantageous when dealing with forms of diverse complexities.


You can check the types and the test form in the Utils folder in the project to learn the basics of the JSON FORM.

There are lots of field types, all of the with and extra label field and conditionals.
